# Synapse ordering

Synapses are located on axons and <x, y> locations are recorded in table. The order of observation may not match order of synapse along axon. This script presents a general method of determining the order of synapses along axon, indexed by table row. It assumes that order is dependent on Euclidean distance, so acute angles or tortuosity may cause the algorithm to find incorrect, but not terrible solutions.
